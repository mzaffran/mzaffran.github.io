I am a third year PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en), at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, and at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development), Saclay (CIFRE PhD).

I am supervised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/), from INRIA, and by [Olivier Féron](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/feron-olivier/) (director of the [FiME laboratory](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/home/)) and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from EDF.

My research project is about statistical learning methods for energy management. In particular, I am interested in distribution-free uncertainty quantification.

##### Events to come

*February 9, 2023.* I will give a talk on conformal prediction with missing values at the [MIA seminar](https://www6.inrae.fr/mia-paris/Seminaires/Seminaire-MIA-Paris-Saclay) of [AgroParisTech](https://www.agroparistech.fr/en). Thanks for the invitation!

*February 13, 2023.* I will give a talk on conformal prediction with missing values at the [PhD students seminar](https://www.lpsm.paris/en/seminaires/gtt/index) of [LPSM](https://www.lpsm.paris/en/index). Thanks for the invitation!

##### News

- The [Young Statisticians and Probabilists](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) day was held, thanks to all the speakers for the amazing talks! You can find the slides and their contact [here](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) (very soon).  
- I was very honored to receive the [Séphora Berrebi Scholarships for Women in Advanced Mathematics](https://www.sephoraberrebi.ai/). Many thanks to the [Séphora Berrebi Association](https://www.sephoraberrebi.org/).
- From August to October 2022, I was visiting [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/) and his group at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/). Thanks for hosting me! I also thank the [FMJH and LMH](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/fmjh-supports/research/junior-scientific-visibility/) for funding this stay abroad.

##### Community

I am the current vice-president of the [Young Statisticians Group](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/468-les_jeunes_statisticiens/) of the French Statistical Society ([SFdS](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/)).

Have a look at the activities of our [causal inference and missing values group](https://misscausal.gitlabpages.inria.fr/misscausal.gitlab.io/index.html) at INRIA, led by Julie Josse, principal investigator of the [PreMeDICaL team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/).
