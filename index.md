I am a third year PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en), at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, and at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development), Saclay.

I am supervised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/), from INRIA, and by [Olivier Féron](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/feron-olivier/) (director of the [FiME laboratory](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/home/)) and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from EDF.

My research project is about statistical learning methods for energy management. In particular, I am interested in distribution-free uncertainty quantification.

##### News

- Super excited to announce that I have been named one of the [Fondation L’Oréal-UNESCO 2023 French Young Talents](https://www.fondationloreal.com/sites/default/files/2023-10/dpfrance_fwis2023-web.pdf), along with 34 amazing French doctorate and post-doctorate women scientists!
- Just released an [introductive tutorial (slides) on Conformal Prediction](https://conformalpredictionintro.github.io/)! Going from the standard split mean-regression case towards beyond exchangeability, passing by conditional coverage, classification, and no (other) splitting strategies.
- Super happy that the work with Aymeric Dieuleveut, Julie Josse, and [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/), [*Conformal Prediction with Missing Values*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02732), was accepted to [ICML 2023](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/)!  
- I was very honored to receive the [Séphora Berrebi Scholarship for Women in Advanced Mathematics](https://www.sephoraberrebi.ai/). Many thanks to the [Séphora Berrebi Association](https://www.sephoraberrebi.org/).

##### Upcoming events

*September 10, 2023.* I will give a [half-day tutorial on Conformal Prediction](https://conferences.enbis.org/event/41/) as part of the [ENBIS Annual Conference](https://conferences.enbis.org/event/32/overview) in Valencia. Many thanks for the invitation! [Slides available.](http://mzaffran.github.io/assets/files/Talks/Tuto_CP_ENBIS_ECAS.pdf)

*September 18-22, 2023.* Attending [StatMathAppli Summer School](https://statmathappli.mathnum.inrae.fr/), where I will also give a contributed talk.

*October 24, 2023.* I will give a talk at the [Statistics and Optimization Seminar of IMT](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/category/474/) in Toulouse. Many thanks for the invitation!

##### Community

I am the current president of the [Young Statisticians Group](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/468-les_jeunes_statisticiens/) of the French Statistical Society ([SFdS](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/)).  
We have organized the 11th [Young Statisticians and Probabilists day](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/). Thanks to all the speakers for the amazing talks! You can find the slides and their contact [here](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) (very soon).

Have a look at the activities of our [causal inference and missing values group](https://misscausal.gitlabpages.inria.fr/misscausal.gitlab.io/index.html) at INRIA, led by Julie Josse, principal investigator of the [PreMeDICaL team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/).

I served as a reviewer for [AISTATS 2023](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=aistats+2023) ([10% top reviewer](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/reviewers.html)) and for the [Journal of Business and Economics Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ubes20).
