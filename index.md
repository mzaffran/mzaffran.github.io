I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Statistics Department of UC Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), working with [Ryan Tibshirani](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ryantibs/).

In June 2024 I completed [my PhD in statistics](http://mzaffran.github.io/assets/files/Zaffran_PhD_Manuscript.pdf), under the supervision of [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, of [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/), from [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en), and of [Olivier Féron](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/feron-olivier/) (director of the [FiME laboratory](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/home/)) and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development).

I am interested in **predictive uncertainty quantification**, especially with *distribution-free finite-sample guarantees in a post-hoc setting*. During my PhD, I had a particular emphasis in the context of *time series* or *missing features*.

##### News

- Very happy to announce that I succesfully defended my PhD last Tuesday! A huge thanks to the members of the jury. [Slides available](http://mzaffran.github.io/assets/files/Talks/Zaffran_PhD_defense_handout.pdf), as well as the [manuscript](http://mzaffran.github.io/assets/files/Zaffran_PhD_Manuscript.pdf).
- Really enthusiastic that our tutorial's proposition, *Distribution-Free Predictive Uncertainty Quantification: Strengths and Limits of Conformal Prediction*, with Aymeric Dieulveut, was accepted at UAI and ICML! Pick your favorite European destination for the summer and see you there :D
- Super excited to announce that I have been named one of the [Fondation L’Oréal-UNESCO 2023 French Young Talents](https://www.fondationloreal.com/sites/default/files/2023-10/dpfrance_fwis2023-web.pdf), along with 34 amazing French women scientists at the doctoral or post-doctoral level!

##### Upcoming events

*December 1-5, 2025.* I will teach a week-long course on conformal prediction at the 2025 [ECAS](https://ecas.fenstats.eu/)-[SFdS](https://ecas.fenstats.eu/) School [Towards Reliable Machine Learning](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/ecas_2025/748-home/), on the French riviera. Don't hesitate to register, and enjoy December's sun!  

##### Community

I am the current president of the [Young Statisticians Group](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/468-les_jeunes_statisticiens/) of the French Statistical Society ([SFdS](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/)).  
We have organized the 11th [Young Statisticians and Probabilists day](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/). Thanks to all the speakers for the amazing talks! You can find the slides and their contact [here](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) (very soon).

Go give a glance at the research and activities of [Aymeric Dieuleveut's team](https://adieuleveutteam.github.io/), based at Ecole polytechnique.

Have also a look at the activities of our [causal inference and missing values group](https://misscausal.gitlabpages.inria.fr/misscausal.gitlab.io/index.html) at INRIA, led by Julie Josse, principal investigator of the [PreMeDICaL team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/).

I served as a conference reviewer for [AISTATS 2023](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=aistats+2023) ([10% top reviewer](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/reviewers.html)), for [NeurIPS 2023](https://nips.cc/) and as a journal reviewer for the  [Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb), for the [International Journal of Forecasting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-journal-of-forecasting), for the [Machine Learning](https://link.springer.com/journal/10994) journal and for the [Journal of Business and Economics Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ubes20).

##### News archive

- Just released an [introductive tutorial (slides) on Conformal Prediction](https://conformalpredictionintro.github.io/)! Going from the standard split mean-regression case towards beyond exchangeability, passing by conditional coverage, classification, and no (other) splitting strategies.
- Super happy that the work with Aymeric Dieuleveut, Julie Josse, and [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/), [*Conformal Prediction with Missing Values*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02732), was accepted to [ICML 2023](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/)!
- I was very honored to receive the [Séphora Berrebi Scholarship for Women in Advanced Mathematics](https://www.sephoraberrebi.ai/). Many thanks to the [Séphora Berrebi Association](https://www.sephoraberrebi.org/).
- From August to October 2022, I was visiting [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/) and his group at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/). Thanks for hosting me! I also thank the [FMJH and LMH](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/fmjh-supports/research/junior-scientific-visibility/) for funding this stay abroad.
- Our paper, [*Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07282), has been accepted to [ICML 2022](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2022/)!
- My Master's thesis was awarded the prize of the best end-of-studies project by [ENSTA Alumni](https://www.ensta.org/fr/). Thanks a lot to them, and to [Philippe Naveau](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/visu.php?id=44&uid=naveau) who supervised me!
- I presented *Adaptive Conformal Predictions for Time Series* at the International Seminar on Distribution-Free Statistics [(ISDFS)](https://sites.google.com/view/isdfs/home). Thanks a lot [Anastasios](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~angelopoulos/) for the kind invitation!
