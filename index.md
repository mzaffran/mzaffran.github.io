I am a third year PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en), at [CMAP](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/en), Ecole Polytechnique, and at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/who-we-are/activities/research-and-development), Saclay (CIFRE PhD).

I am supervised by [Aymeric Dieuleveut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) from CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, by [Julie Josse](http://juliejosse.com/), from INRIA, and by [Olivier Féron](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/feron-olivier/) (director of the [FiME laboratory](https://www.fime-lab.org/en/home/)) and [Yannig Goude](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~goude/about.html) from EDF.

My research project is about statistical learning methods for energy management. In particular, I am interested in distribution-free uncertainty quantification.

##### Upcoming events

*April 25, 2023.* With [Claire Boyer](https://perso.lpsm.paris/~cboyer/), we will give a [course on uncertainty quantification in machine learning](https://claireboyer.github.io/tutorial-conformal-prediction/) at [FEMTO-ST](https://www.femto-st.fr/en), for the [MASPIN days](https://www.femto-st.fr/fr/L-institut/evenements/2eme-edition-des-journees-maspin-mathematiques-appliquees-et-sciences-pour). Thanks Claire for this opportunity!

##### News

- Super happy that the work with Aymeric, Julie and [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/), [*Conformal Prediction with Missing Values*](https://hal.science/hal-03896384), was accepted for [ICML 2023](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2023/)!
- The [Young Statisticians and Probabilists](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) day was held, thanks to all the speakers for the amazing talks! You can find the slides and their contact [here](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/fr/jeunes_statisticiens/manifestations/journees_ysp/564-accueil_ysp/) (very soon).  
- I was very honored to receive the [Séphora Berrebi Scholarship for Women in Advanced Mathematics](https://www.sephoraberrebi.ai/). Many thanks to the [Séphora Berrebi Association](https://www.sephoraberrebi.org/).
- From August to October 2022, I was visiting [Yaniv Romano](https://sites.google.com/view/yaniv-romano/) and his group at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/home-2/). Thanks for hosting me! I also thank the [FMJH and LMH](https://www.fondation-hadamard.fr/en/fmjh-supports/research/junior-scientific-visibility/) for funding this stay abroad.

##### Community

I am the current vice-president of the [Young Statisticians Group](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/en/jeunes_statisticiens/468-les_jeunes_statisticiens/) of the French Statistical Society ([SFdS](https://www.sfds.asso.fr/)).

Have a look at the activities of our [causal inference and missing values group](https://misscausal.gitlabpages.inria.fr/misscausal.gitlab.io/index.html) at INRIA, led by Julie Josse, principal investigator of the [PreMeDICaL team](https://team.inria.fr/premedical/).

I served as a reviewer for [AISTATS 2023](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=aistats+2023) ([10% top reviewer](http://aistats.org/aistats2023/reviewers.html)) and for the [Journal of Business and Economics Statistics](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/ubes20).
